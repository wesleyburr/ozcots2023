## Why Do We 'Grade' Students?

I have four questions for you to consider.

* What is the **purpose** of assessing students' work?
* Where did grades **come from**?
* How do we grade, and **cui bono**?
* How do we **resolve the conflict** between grade stakeholders?

---

## An overly hyperbolic statement

**I do not know one (statistics) colleague who genuinely enjoys the act of grading undergraduate student work**. It is drudgery at best; hellish at worst.

## How Far Has This Spread?

> * numerous converts in the mathematical, statistical and computational sciences
> * some publicity in 2016, then a surge of interest after 2020
> * some links for those interested

## My Experience

I teach a broad cross-section of 2nd through 4th year
undergraduate courses, and occasional graduate specialist
courses. I have implemented variations of specifications
grading in:

> * 5 iterations of Mathematical Statistics (2nd year)
> * 2 iterations of Stochastic Processes (4th year)
> * 3 iterations of Linear Models (3rd year)
> * 2 iterations of Experimental Design (4th year)
> * 1 iteration of Statistical Learning (3rd year)

All from 2018 Fall through 2023 Winter - 5 years.

## How does it work: Mathematical Statistics

* broke course down into the most atomic learning outcomes feasible
* in its latest iteration:
    - a total of 30 target concepts, with 15 accompanying challenge areas (45 modular pieces)
    - students work independently, submitting work weekly
    - any item can be redone: all are graded on successful/unsuccessful (S/U)
    - maximum number of **submissions** per week

## Mathematical Statistics: Example Topics

> * Target Concept 13: Sampling Distributions I
> * Target Concept 21: Bootstrap-t CIs for Means
> * Challenge Problem 9: Parametric CI Simulation

---

## How does it Work: Linear Models

* second major course, Linear Models, is a 3rd-year
course on linear models for statistics majors
* students largely **choose** to be in the class,
* more mathematically and academically mature than the students in Mathematical Statistics

* the course is broken into modules, each of which is fairly
broad
* each module has a bank of problems
* students complete a set number of problems from each module (e.g., best 6 count)
* they may do as few or as many problems as they wish
* each problem is graded on a NA/Bronze/Silver/Gold scale
* problems may not be redone, but additional problems from the module may

---

## Advantages to Both

* grading is very simple - specifications make for extremely easy and rapid assessment of student performance
* students have full control over their final grades, based entirely on their performance on the assessments
* significantly reduced grade and test anxiety
* feedback feels meaningful but not punitive
* most students really like the system

---

## Disadvantages to Both

* both systems are more complicated to implement
* preparing larger banks of problems, and refreshing them, is higher workload
* students can fall behind, and have no effective way of 'catching up'
* depends heavily on student engagement and academic integrity

---

## Is It Worth It?

I can't imagine going back. Students are happier, I'm happier, and the students' overall comprehension is
either higher, or at least comparable at worst.

I don't hate grading when it's done in this framework.

If you are interested in trying a variation, reach out: I'd be happy to share my materials and details of my implementations.
